                <h4>Why should you use languageSwap when there are so many apps and tools to learn languages?</h4>
                <p class="pl-3 text-justify text-muted font-weight-light">
                    LanguageSwap allows you to meet real people and create a connection that will help you when you are struggling with the challenges of learning a new language.
                    Plus, we know that sometimes people are very worried of making mistakes when learning a new language, so meeting someone who is also trying to learn a language may help you understand that everyone struggles at something!

                    Yes, of course! You will meet many people who are trying to learn like you, so nobody should charge you as if it was a tutoring lesson!
