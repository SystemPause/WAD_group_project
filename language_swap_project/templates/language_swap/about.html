                LanguageSwap allows you to meet real people and create a connection that will help you when you are struggling with the challenges of learning a new language.
                Plus, we know that sometimes people are very worried of making mistakes when learning a new language, so meeting someone who is also trying to learn a language may help you understand that everyone struggles at something!
